# Data Analysis Repository

Welcome to the **Data Analysis Repository**, which showcases the application of data analysis techniques relevant to autonomous driving and smart mobility engineering. As part of my journey to become an Autonomous Driving and Smart Mobility Engineer, I have explored and developed data analysis skills in this domain. While Python is my primary tool, I am also proficient in SQL for managing and querying large datasets.
