    "### ✅ 2. Research Background\n",
    "##### A. Health Impacts of PM2.5\n",
    "* PM2.5 refers to fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less.\n",
    "* According to OECD data, as of 2020, South Korea's PM2.5 concentration stands at 25.3 µg/m³, over <span style=\"color:orange;\">five times</span> worse than Finland, the least polluted country (4.9 µg/m³).\n",
    "* WHO identifies PM2.5 as a <span style=\"color:orange;\">major pollutant</span> linked directly to cardiovascular disease, respiratory illness, and premature death.\n",
    "* *[Ref] [**How Much Can EVs Reduce Air Pollution?**](https://www.si.re.kr/node/59902?utm_source=)*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### B. Direct Link to Vehicle Emissions\n",
    "* PM2.5 is a <span style=\"color:orange;\">primary pollutant</span> emitted by internal combustion engine vehicles (diesel). By 2050, a projected EV adoption rate of 54% is expected to reduce pollutant emissions by 77% compared to 2016 levels.\n",
    "* However, while increasing EV adoption is expected to reduce PM2.5 levels, <span style=\"color:orange;\">secondary contributors</span> such as tire and brake wear must also be considered.\n",
    "* *[Ref] [**The Real Culprits of Vehicle-Related Fine Dust**](https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/science/science_general/921777.html)*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### C. Policy Priorities\n",
    "* South Korea's <span style=\"color:orange;\">‘Seasonal Fine Dust Management Policy’</span> aims to improve air quality by targeting PM2.5.\n",
    "* PM2.5, classified as ultrafine dust, has greater adverse effects on human health compared to PM10, making it a key <span style=\"color:orange;\">indicator</span> for assessing air quality improvements.\n",
    "* *[Ref] [**Lowest PM2.5 Levels Recorded Over the Past Five Years During the 5th Seasonal Management Period**](https://me.go.kr/home/web/board/read.do?pagerOffset=0&maxPageItems=10&maxIndexPages=10&searchKey=title&searchValue=%EC%A0%9C5%EC%B0%A8+%EB%AF%B8%EC%84%B8%EB%A8%BC%EC%A7%80+%EA%B3%84%EC%A0%88%EA%B4%80%EB%A6%AC%EC%A0%9C&menuId=10525&orgCd=&boardId=1667850&boardMasterId=1&boardCategoryId=&decorator=)*\n",

    "### ✅ 3. Data Overview\n",
    "##### A. Data Sources\n",
    "* Monthly regional air pollution data for 2023 (Air Korea, https://www.airkorea.or.kr/web/last_amb_hour_data?pMENU_NO=123)\n",
    "* Regional EV statistics (KEPCO, https://www.data.go.kr/data/15039554/fileData.do)\n",
    "    - To address timeline inconsistencies, the analysis will use December 2023 data instead of the latest July 2024 data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### B. Key Variables\n",
    "* Regional EV ownership ratio: {(Number of EVs in a region / Total number of EVs nationwide) * 100}\n",
    "* Air pollution variables: PM2.5, PM10, NO₂ (vehicle emissions-related), SO₂ (industrial emissions-related), CO (traffic congestion-related).\n",
    "* Time variable: Monthly data for time-series analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 4. Analysis Process\n",
    "##### A. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "* Check for outliers and missing values in the \"2023 Monthly Regional Air Pollution Data.\"\n",
    "    * Normalize using mean and max values for each pollutant.\n",
    "    * *[Ref] Data_Analysis.ipynb_Analysis 2*\n",
    "* Process the \"Regional EV Statistics\" as of December 31, 2023, to derive basic descriptive statistics.\n",
    "    * *[Ref] Data_Analysis.ipynb_Analysis 5* \n",
    "\n",
    "##### B. Correlation Analysis\n",
    "* Compute Pearson and Spearman correlations between EV ownership ratios and PM2.5 concentrations.\n",
    "* Compare air pollution levels between regions with high and low EV adoption rates.\n",

    "### ✅ 5. Final Visualization Plan\n",
    "##### A. Scatter Plot\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:aquamarine;font-weight:bold;\">*[FINAL] Scatter Plot: EV Ownership Ratio vs. PM2.5*</span>\n",
    "* Purpose: Visualize the correlation between EV ownership ratios and PM2.5 concentrations.\n",
    "* Components:\n",
    "    - X-axis: EV Ownership Ratio (%)\n",
    "    - Y-axis: PM2.5 Concentration (µg/m³)\n",
    "    - Each point represents a region, with region names labeled.\n",

    "##### B. Composite Heatmap\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:aquamarine;font-weight:bold;\">*final_ev_pm25_heatmap.html*</span>\n",
    "* Purpose: Provide a visual representation of regional EV ownership ratios and PM2.5 concentrations.\n",
    "* Components:\n",
    "    - PM2.5 Concentration Heatmap:\n",
    "        - Visualization: Display PM2.5 concentrations for each region using a heatmap (color gradient: red to green).\n",
    "        - Interpretation: Higher PM2.5 levels are represented in red, while lower levels are shown in green.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - EV Ownership Ratio Circle Marker:\n",
    "        - Visualization: Represent regional EV ownership ratios using circle markers' size and opacity.\n",
    "        - Interpretation: Larger, more opaque circles indicate higher EV ownership ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Interactive Pop-Up:\n",
    "        - Display regional PM2.5 concentrations and EV ownership ratios upon hover.\n"
